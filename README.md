# phase-1-dom-personal-project

For this project, I built a simple web app to practice manipulating the DOM and event handling.

"Streaming Buddy" is an app where a user can add content (e.g., TV shows, movies) from a library to their own individual watch list. A user can also submit a form to add more content to the Library.
